Edit dev.exs to connect to your empty database. Once the server is started and you visit localhost:4000 you can run the DB migrations from there. 

To start your Phoenix server:

* Run `mix setup` to install and setup dependencies
* Start Phoenix endpoint with `mix phx.server` or inside IEx with `iex -S mix phx.server`

Now you can visit [`localhost:4000`](http://localhost:4000) from your browser.

The page with realtime is located at the url [`localhost:4000/posts`](http://localhost:4000/posts)
